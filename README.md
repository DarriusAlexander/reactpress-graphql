## Gettings started

### Install and configure Wordpress

React developpers, you can use https://pantheon.io/ to install a Wordpress site and use it as a service. Then :

- Enable wp-graphql extension : https://wpgraphql.com/docs/getting-started/install-and-activate/
- Add this to your wp-config.php to make sure CORS are enabled :

```php
// allow CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

### Install ReactPress

```sh
npm install
# start the dev server.
npm run dev
```

By default, reactpress uses a demo API. To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and edit variable **wordpressGraphqlEndpoint** so that it points to your wordpress graphql endpoint.

```js
export default {
  wordpressGraphqlEndpoint: "https://dev-reactpress.pantheonsite.io/graphql"
};
```

You're ready to go ! You can now start working by looking / hacking / editing files from **themes/starter** directory.
