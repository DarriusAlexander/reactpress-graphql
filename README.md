# WORDPRESS + REACT = REACTPRESS ðŸ’› - ( GrapqhQL version )

Add a SEO-friendly React front-end to your Wordpress in minutes.

## Gettings started

### Configure Wordpress

Enable https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql extension.
Add this to your wp-config.php to make sure CORS are enabled :

```php
// allow CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

### Install ReactPress

npm install
# start the dev server.
npm run dev

By default, reactpress uses a demo API. To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and edit variable **wordpressGraphqlEndpoint** so that it points to your wordpress graphql endpoint.

```js
export default {
  wordpressGraphqlEndpoint: "https://dev-reactpress.pantheonsite.io/graphql"
};
```

You're ready to go ! You can now start working by looking / hacking / editing files from **themes/starter** directory.
